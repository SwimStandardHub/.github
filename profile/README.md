**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

## Introduction
Swim Standard Hub is intended to be a place where the documentation of various standards for data exchange in swimming will be listed, discussed and, in some cases, further developed.

## How to get part of the community
Everyone is invited to become part of the community. Please contact us with a short description of yourself. What role do you play in the swimming community so far? Are you a volunteer member? Part of a technical committee? Or a developer of software for swimming?

Everyone is welcome to contribute their expertise.
